# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Initialized github repository, created empty Android project, added libraries for architecture, ui and audio, added empty Activity.

**Thoughts:** It always feels very exiting to start a new project. This is good opportunity to learn new libraries and skills.
