# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Initialized github repository, created empty Android project, added libraries for architecture, ui and audio, added empty Activity.

**Thoughts:** It always feels very exiting to start a new project. This is good opportunity to learn new libraries and skills.

### Day 2: July 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Decided to complete Dagger codelab before using it in my project. Learned about components, modules, binds, subcomponents, scopes.

**Thoughts:** Love this interactive codelab concept. Probably this codelab provides some outdated techniques, but maybe it's good to learn fundamentals.

### Day 3: July 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished Dagger codelab! Learned about scoping multiple activities, testing, provides annotation and qualifiers.

**Thoughts:** Dagger seems to me overcomplicated. But I should go deeper to understand advanced use cases.
